Purpose: In the life cycle of arthropods, such as the Lucilia sericata fly species, temperature, and humidity play crucial roles in their development and overall survival. Understanding the relationship between environmental factors and the emergence rates of larvae is vital for studying these organisms’ ecological and physiological dynamics. This study aims to investigate the effects of different temperature conditions and constant humidity on the emergence rates of Lucilia sericata larvae. To achieve this, we utilized eggs of Lucilia sericata obtained from our laboratory culture established in 2007. The eggs were exposed to various temperature treatments, and the emergence rates of larvae were monitored under constant humidity conditions.
Method: The experiments were conducted using 100 eggs of Lucilia sericata obtained from adult flies. These eggs were placed on a mixture of chicken liver and agar agar nutrient mediums. The mediums were then subjected to different temperature conditions in an incubator, with humidity maintained at 45%. The temperature conditions included 0°C, 5°C, 7°C, and 10°C to 41°C, with increments of 1°C between each experimental stage. The eggs were observed and monitored for 24, 48, and 72 hours under these temperature conditions. Eggs kept in the temperature range of 0°C to 13°C and 39°C to 41°C were observed for 24 hours. After the 24-hour observation period, eggs that were maintained at 30°C were examined for larval emergence after being held for an additional 48 hours. The emerged larvae were counted and recorded. Each temperature degree experiment was repeated three times, and a control group was maintained at 30°C with a humidity level of 45% in the incubator.
Results: When subjected to incubation at temperatures of 0 °C, 5 °C, 7 °C, 10 °C, and 41 °C for a duration of 24 hours, followed by a transfer to an incubator set at 30 °C for an additional 48 hours, no larvae emerged from the eggs. Subsequently, these eggs were transferred to a 30°C incubator and held for an additional 24 hours. The eggs incubated at 30°C for 24 hours did not produce larvae. Eggs incubated at 11°C, 12°C, and 13°C for 72 hours also did not yield larvae, but when transferred to a 30°C incubator for 24 hours, larvae emerged from 5.3% of eggs incubated at 11°C, 25.7% at 12°C, and 26.7% at 13°C. In the case of eggs incubated at 14°C, 15°C, 16°C, 17°C, and 18°C, no larvae emerged within the first 24 hours. However, after 48 hours, larvae emerged from 61.7% of eggs incubated at 14°C, 67.0% at 15°C, 63.0% at 16°C, 69.0% at 17°C, and 80.7% at 18°C. Eggs incubated in the temperature range of 19°C to 38°C for 24 hours resulted in 80.3% larval emergence, with the highest rate observed at 28°C with 89.7% larval emergence. For eggs incubated at 39°C, only 7.7% produced larvae, while at 40°C, the larval emergence rate was 1%. In conclusion, temperatures below 10°C and above 40°C were found to have a significant impact on Lucilia sericata fly eggs, with no larval emergence observed. However, a significant difference in larval emergence rates was observed between temperatures ranging from 14°C to 38°C, as well as between 10°C to 14°C and 39°C to 41°C.
